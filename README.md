# programmers-seal-of-approval

Are you tired of QA making up bugs just to screw your life? 

Add this simple widget for them to know your software is not prone to bugs.

## Usage

Just include this script tag before your opening body tag:

```html
<script src = "http://slashman.github.io/programmers-seal-of-approval/psoa.js"></script>
```

Make sure your content security policy for scripts allows http://slashman.github.io/, or you
may just want to download the script and apply it on your own project. It could save your life!
